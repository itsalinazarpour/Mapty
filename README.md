# Mapty with Jin

**Here is my [Mapty]() project with some additional features!!**

<span style="color: red;">`Somehow the map from leaflet is only showing on firefox`</span>, So you should open and take a look this project on firefox :wink:

## What I did in this project

- **Rebuild** project with **MVC pattern** and **Sass**
- **Markup** and **styling** for new created **submenus** && realistic **error message**
- Abilities to **edit** & **delete** workout and **delete all** workouts
- Ability to **sort** workouts by certain fields(distance, time)
- Position the map to **show all workouts**
- **Using Mapty Icons** instead of just normal points on the map
- **Geocode location** from coordinates and display it on the workout list
- **Display weather** for workout time and place
